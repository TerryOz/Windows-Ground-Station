Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are no special installation instructions for this software.  Place 
it in a suitable directory and run it.  Java 1.8 runtime environment is 
required.  You can download it from java.com.

By default the settings and downloaded keps are written in your home
directory.  You can change that behaviour by launching the program with
a directory as a command line paramater.  Then the settings and keps will
be written in that directory.  This is useful if you want to have more than
one tracker monitoring different keps files or just a different set of
spacecraft.

Usage Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you run the tracker for the first time some default spacecraft are 
shown for the default location.  Click on the settings button, bottom left
and change the latitude/longitude of the ground station to your location.
You can remove the existing spacecraft with the "Clear" button and then 
select the spacecraft you want to track.  If the spacecraft you want to 
track are not in the nasabare.txt file, then specify a differnt URL for 
the keps file.
