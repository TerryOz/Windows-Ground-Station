​FoxTelem
~~~~~~~~

The Foxtelem Manual (pdf) describes the steps to install FoxTelem for the first 
time.  It has also been updated for all the new changes and features in this 
release.

If you already have FoxTelem installed, we recommend that you install this 
version in a new directory.  First, take a copy of your data and save it
as a backup.  When you run FoxTelem for the first time it should 
locate your existing data.  If you are running it from a shortcut, script or 
batchfile, make sure you change the shortcut to the new program.  The location 
of the logfiles stays the same.

If your existing data is not loaded, then go to File > Settings screen and 
select the log files directory.  This may be the old installation directory 
if you picked the "simple" installation method originally and wrote the data 
files in the same directory as FoxTelem.  

If you do not like the location of your data you can simply copy the folder 
somewhere else. You can then "point" FoxTelem at the data folder from the 
File > Settings menu.  In this way, you can have as many data folders as you 
like.

For example, you can setup two or more logfile directories.  One for your local
data and one for data downloaded from the server. See the manual for details.

You can also create different scripts, batchfiles or shortcuts to launch as
many copies of FoxTelem as you like.  Pass the path to the logfile directories 
on the command line.
